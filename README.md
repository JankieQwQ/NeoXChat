# XChat Robot

XChat Robot is a convenient tool for quickly developing XChat bots. For detailed usage, please refer to the example code in `TestBot.py`.

## Important Notes

1. __The code is periodically updated, so it is recommended to follow for updates.__

2. __To develop a bot, you need to apply for a token from the XChat administrators. This token is required for the bot to pass the human verification process.__

3. Fun Fact: This library can also detect programmers' IQ. Currently, two individuals have been detected as having an inadequate IQ. I hope you are not the third one, so please **carefully observe** the code inside `TestBot.py`!
